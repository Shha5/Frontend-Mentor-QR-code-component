## My process

I started with structuring the HTML document using mainly <div> tags. I used different classes to make styling elements easier. I used grid to center elements on the page. To make things easier, I set the width of the main container to look as depicted on the design file for mobile screen. I added rows above and under the container to ensure there is enough space between the top and beginning of the container, as well as the end of container and bottom of the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project for me was an intorduction to using HTML and CSS on my own, without a tutorial of any kind. Overall, this project helped me understand the basics of CSS and HTML. I made loads of mistakes, and probably was not keeping to best practice. I think of this project as a step on the road, which I can look back on after to see my progress.


### Continued development

I am just at the beginning of my journey with FE, so there's everything I need to learn. As a next step, I need to understand more thoroughly how to structure documents using HTML, and CSS grid and flexbox.
